# Nikoro

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Telegram-Bot-Node/Nikoro.svg?branch=es6)](https://travis-ci.org/Telegram-Bot-Node/Nikoro)

An all-in-one, plugin-based, Telegram bot written in Node.js. 

See it in action on [@nikorobot](https://telegram.me/nikorobot)! [TODO]

Based on [node-telegram-bot-api](https://github.com/yagop/node-telegram-bot-api).

## Quick install

```
git clone https://github.com/Telegram-Bot-Node/Nikoro
cd Nikoro
npm run setup:guided
```

After running `npm run bot`, you can simply add the bot to a group chat and it will work. You can also message it directly.

To see a list of available plugins, use the command `/help`; if you need help about a specific plugin, do `/help PluginName`.

See the [usage guide](http://telegram-bot-node.github.io/Nikoro/dist/user.html) for more information.
