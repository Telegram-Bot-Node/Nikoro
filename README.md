##Features
  
<!--  * 20+ plugins already available! -->
<!-- * Inline plugins available! -->
* **Plugin-based**: run many bots in one, have a plugin for everything.
* Completely **customizable**: see something you don't like? Just change it!
* Written in **Node.js**: one of the most powerful and easiest programming language available.
* Easy to install: just a few simple commands and your bot is up and running!
* Easy-to-write plugins: with many helper functions write powerful plugins in a few minutes. 
    * Connect to a database, download files, parse commands without writing any code: everything is already here for you   
* Open Source :D

##Running the bot

* Clone the repository
* Install a Redis server
* `npm install`
* Create a Telegram bot and get the bot token (https://core.telegram.org/bots/#botfather)
* Configure the bot with `npm run configure`
>Hint: you can find the available plugins in the `src/plugins` folder.

* Compile the bot: `node node_modules/.bin/babel src/ -d dist/`
* Run the bot with `node dist/Bot.js`
>You can stop the bot at any time with Ctrl+C.

##Using the bot
You can simply add the bot to a group chat and it will work. You can also message it directly.

To see a list of available plugins, use the command `/help`; if you need help about a specific plugin, do `/help pluginName`.

## Plugins

If you know JavaScript (ES6, specifically), you can easily write plugins for your bot.

>The documentation may not be up to date, or may not cover some special cases yet. If you want to write your own plugin, it is suggested that you look at some existing plugins (`plugins/` folder), like Ping.

### Adding a plugin

* Create a file in `src/plugins`, for example, `src/plugins/MyPlugin.js`.
>You can use `Ping.js` as a template.
* Edit `config.json`. Add `"MyPlugin"` to the list of active plugins:

```json
activePlugins: {
    "Auth",
    "Config",
    "MyPlugin"
}
```

### Writing

See `docs/Plugin.md`, `docs/Util.md`.
