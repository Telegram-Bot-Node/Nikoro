##Running the Bot

* Clone/Download/Fork the repository
    * `git clone https://github.com/crisbal/Telegram-Bot-Node`
* Install `redis` (and check if it is working)
* `npm install`
* Create a Bot on Telegram 
    * Get the associated HTTP Api Token (https://core.telegram.org/bots/#botfather)
* Set the required Environment Variables (two methods)
    1. Via `setup.sh`
        * Edit `setup.sh`
            * Set `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` with the auth token of your bot
            * Set the other API Keys if you want to enable the relative plugins.
        * Run `source setup.sh`
    2. Set them manually in `config.js`
        * If you are more comfortable this way
    3. Set them in any other way in your system
        * If you can't/won't use the `source` command     
* Edit config.js
    * Edit `activePlugins` if you want to edit the active plugins. It is an array of the filenames of the active plugins. 
        * You can find all the available plugins in the `plugins` folder.
* Run the bot
    * `node bot.js` 
    * Stop it at any time with CTRL+C

##Using the Bot

Send a message to the bot or add it to a group chat and you are ready to use it!

Use ```/list``` to see a list of the enabled plugins or ```/help <plugin-name>``` to get an explanation for each enabled plugin.

##Plugins

Plugins can be easly written with a basic understanding of JavaScript.

Check the ```plugins``` folder to see the available plugins and check each file to see a basic explanation for each plugin.

###Writing custom plugins

* Take a look at the provided plugins in the ```plugins``` folder
* Create a ```.js``` file in the ```plugins``` folder

Basic Class Skeleton
``` javascript
var pluginName = function(){
    
    this.properties = {
        shortDescription: "Set a simple and short description for your plugin here.",
        fullHelp: "Add examples, an in-depth explanation here."
        //both these fields are required
    };

    this.on('text', function (msg, reply) {
        //this will be executed whenever your bot get a text message
        //you can listen to many events, just take a look at the example plugins.
        
        /*
            1. Check if the msg.text matches the trigger for your plugin
            2. Do stuff you need
            3. Produce reply 
                replyText = {type:"text", text:"Message you want to post"}
                replyAudio = {type:"audio", audio:"path/to/audio.mp3"}
                replyPhoto = {type:"photo", photo:"path/to/photo.png"}
                replyStatus = {type:"status", status:"typing"}
            4. Post the reply
                reply(replyText); //for example


        */
        if(msg.text == "hello")
            reply({type:"text", text:"Hey there!"});
    });

};

module.exports = pluginName;
```
